My public repo for https://projecteuler.net problems, which I'm using as

1. a daily kata of sorts
2. a supplement to my continued learning of mathematics 

### Important 

Project Euler strongly discourages sharing your answers publicly.  I'm fully aware that I'm going against their suggestion with this repository.  However, I wanted to keep a public record of my progress and to show my answers in various languages for others to compare to.

If you have not yet solved a problem please refrain from viewing my answers for that given problem.
